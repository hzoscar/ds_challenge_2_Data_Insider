# Data Insider - Data Visualization Challenge

Welcome to the Data Insider project! This repository documents my journey through the second challenge of the Alura LATAM Data Science challenges, focusing on data visualization.

## Overview
In this challenge, I delved into understanding the behavior of large corporations worldwide using different editions of Forbes 2000 from 2015 onwards. Additionally, data from Fortune 500 editions from 2015 onwards was also analyzed.

## Objectives
The primary objective was to produce a detailed report to objectively understand the behavior of these corporations. This involved merging datasets, analyzing discrepancies, and providing insights through data visualization techniques.

## Data Sources
All necessary data until 2022 were provided, and additional datasets were obtained from [data.world](https://data.world/aroissues/forbes-global-2000-2008-2019). 

## Challenges and Solutions
One of the main challenges was merging the Forbes 2000 datasets with the Fortune Global 500 datasets. To address this, I utilized the `fuzzywuzzy` library to locate companies appearing on the Fortune list that did not correspond to the Forbes list.

## Analysis Approach
After preparing the datasets, analyses and insights were documented based on provided questionnaires. For each question, a graph was created. Additionally, I implemented racing bar charts and an interactive bubble plot to enhance visualization.

## Additional Sections
Beyond the challenge requirements, I included three additional sections:
1. **Analysis by Author**: Personal analysis leading to a presentation included in this repository.
2. **Interactive Bubble Plot**: An engaging visualization created using the `bubbly` library.
3. **Further Insights**: Additional analysis and insights on the datasets.

## Challenge Structure
The challenge is divided into the following eight parts:
1. **Setting up the Environment**
2. **Data Collection**
3. **Data Wrangling**
4. **Table Summarization and Exploratory Analysis**
5. **Data Query**
6. **Insights**
7. **Bubble Plot**
8. **Further Insights - 2**
